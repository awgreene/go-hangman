# How to contribute to this project

## Getting the source code

To start with, we’ll need the source code for the project. It’s important that it lives inside the GOPATH, so the easiest way to grab the code is with go get:

```
go get github.com/mauricioabreu/go-hangman
```

Now you can work from the following path:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mauricioabreu/go-hangman
```

To contribute to the project, you can add your remote fork to the git yourself:

```
git remote add GITHUB_USER https://github.com/GITHUB_USER/go-hangman
```

## Running the tests

In the root project, run the command `go test -v ./...` in order to execute the test suite.

## Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not reported already. The [issues index](https://github.com/mauricioabreu/go-hangman/issues) is your best friend <3
* If you did not find a bug report, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/mauricioabreu/go-hangman/issues/new) 

## Do you want to send a bug fix?

* Open a new pull request with the patch.
* Use clean and appropriate git commit messages.

## Do you want to send a new feature or change an existing one?

* Open a new issue so we can discuss the new feature.

## Do you want to add a new test?

I love tests but this project grew up a little fast and I had no control over code coverage.
If you want to send a test case, please go ahead. I would really appreciate the efforts.
